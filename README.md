# Gas Station Simulation
This is a simple Java program that simulates a gas station. The program prompts the user to choose between three types of gasoline (muhasan, normal, and supper) and enter the amount of liters they want to purchase. Based on the user's input, the program calculates the total cost of the purchase and the distance that can be traveled with the purchased amount of gasoline.

# Installation
To run the program, you'll need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java here.

Once you have Java installed, you can compile and run the program using a command line interface. Here are the steps:

Open a command prompt or terminal window
Navigate to the directory where you saved the program files
Compile the program by running the command javac Main.java
Run the program by running the command java Main
# Usage
